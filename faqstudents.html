                Who is eligible to apply for 2hats?
                <br/>
                All students are able to apply to 2hats. We are open to students 	from all backgrounds and faculties.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Am I eligible to apply as international student?
                <br/>
                Yep! However, there may be restrictions on your working hours 	as required by Australian Law.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Can I get a work opportunity overseas or in another state through 2hats?
                <br/>
                Unfortunately, not at the moment. However, we are expanding 	our services to other states within Australia and internationally 	very soon.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Which industries specifically am I able to apply for?
                <br/>
                Whilst you have the option of choosing preferred industries that 	you would like to be placed into, you may receive an offer from 	2hats from a similar industry based upon your skills and 	the information we receive during the selection process.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                What specifically did you require to get a placement through 2hats?
                <br/>
                Whilst other systems may be looking for just academic 	excellence, we at 2hats are trying to find students that are the 	best fit for the role! We help make sure that you have the best 	chance of receiving a placement through our feedback process 	and have multiple avenues of support throughout.

                Can I Apply?

                Are the professional placements paid?
                <br/>
                Yep! You will be paid on a contract basis. After the placement, 	depending on your performance and the resources of the 	company, you may receive an offer of ongoing employment that 	is determined between you and the company. The amount that 	you will receive will depend on the company and the role.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Do I need to pay for the service?
                <br/>
                Nope! Our core career development service is completely free 	for students. We don't charge students thousands of dollars to 	receive a professional placement.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Why should I go through 2hats, instead of any other job portals?
                <br/>
                2hats isn't a job portal or a recruiter. As a career development 	service built for students we help improve and grow you, placing 	you into paid placements and kickstarting your career 	with relevant experience.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                What's the benefit of me going through the assessment with 2hats?
                <br/>
                2hats connects with paid professional work opportunities and 	upskills you through the 	process. Unlike our competitors, we 	help improve your value with feedback and training as 	you go through our selection process.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                What kind of companies 2hats are placing students to?
                <br/>
                2hats has a broad range of company placements from a variety 	of industries.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Is my personal information safe?
                <br/>
                Your privacy is incredibly important to us and we have a strong 	commitment to keep your information private. Your personal 	information will not be disclosed to any third party unless 	you give us permission. For example, it will be used to review 	your resume, or to contact the companies about the placement.

                Register your free account on our website home page and 	upload your resume. The app is available on the Apple App Store 	and the Google Play Store. Just search for '2hats'.
                <br/>

                Unfortunately, we are only available in Australia at the moment! If 	you are an overseas student please make sure to switch your 	app store to the Australian market.

                Is there any difference between submitting my profile through App or Web?
                <br/>
                Essentially both the 2hats App and Web Portal are the same. 	You are able to submit your profile and resume through both.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                What are the processes involved to get a placement?
                <br/>
                The very first step is to make sure that you join our community 	by submitting your resume 	and getting feedback from the 2hats 	team.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                How does the feedback system work? What should I do after receiving a feedback?
                <br/>
                We want to help you grow, which is feedback is at the core of 	2hats. Once you submit your resume you'll either get a 	notification letting you know you have passed to the next round 	or which areas need improvement. You are able to resubmit up 	to 3 times with multiple feedback documents from the 2hats 	team.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Should I fill in the profile or upload the resume?
                <br/>
                You have the option of going with either. As long as you fill in 	your profile or upload your resume, you'll be added into review 	by the 2hats team.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                How long do I need to wait for my feedback?
                <br/>
                This varies as some candidates will progress to the next stage 	where as others may receive the feedback to see where they 	need to improve. You'll receive this feedback as soon as 	possible.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Will I be interviewed by the company again?
                <br/>
                Once you have completed your placement you won't be 	interviewed again. The 2hats team will use your original 	responses in our system as well as the feedback from your past 	working histories to place you into another company.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                How long is the professional placement?
                <br/>
                It varies depending on the structure and the arrangement, in 	general, the initial contract is between 3-6-month, subject to 	negotiation between you and the company. It will all be 	clearly outlined before you begin.

                <br/>
                Essentially both the 2hats App and Web Portal are the same. 	You are able to submit your profile and resume through both.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                What are the processes involved to get a placement?
                <br/>
                The very first step is to make sure that you join our community 	by submitting your resume 	and getting feedback from the 2hats 	team.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                How does the feedback system work? What should I do after receiving a feedback?
                <br/>
                We want to help you grow, which is feedback is at the core of 	2hats. Once you submit your resume you'll either get a 	notification letting you know you have passed to the next round 	or which areas need improvement. You are able to resubmit up 	to 3 times with multiple feedback documents from the 2hats 	team.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Should I fill in the profile or upload the resume?
                <br/>
                You have the option of going with either. As long as you fill in 	your profile or upload your resume, you'll be added into review 	by the 2hats team.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                How long do I need to wait for my feedback?
                <br/>
                This varies as some candidates will progress to the next stage 	where as others may receive the feedback to see where they 	need to improve. You'll receive this feedback as soon as 	possible.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Will I be interviewed by the company again?
                <br/>
                Once you have completed your placement you won't be 	interviewed again. The 2hats team will use your original 	responses in our system as well as the feedback from your past 	working histories to place you into another company.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                How long is the professional placement?
                <br/>
                It varies depending on the structure and the arrangement, in 	general, the initial contract is between 3-6-month, subject to 	negotiation between you and the company. It will all be 	clearly outlined before you begin.

                Who is eligible to apply for 2hats?
                <br/>
                All students are able to apply to 2hats. We are open to students from all backgrounds and 	faculties.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Am I eligible to apply as international student?
                <br/>
                Yep! However, there may be restrictions on your working hours as required by Australian 	Law.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Can I get a work opportunity overseas or in another state through 2hats?
                <br/>
                Unfortunately, not at the moment. However, we are expanding our services to other states 	within Australia and internationally very soon.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Which industries specifically am I able to apply for?
                <br/>
                Whilst you have the option of choosing preferred industries that you would like to be placed 	into, you may receive an offer from 2hats from a similar industry based upon your skills and 	the information we receive during the selection process.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                What specifically did you require to get a placement through 2hats?
                <br/>
                Whilst other systems may be looking for just academic excellence, we at 2hats are trying to 	find students that are the best fit for the role! We help make sure that you have the best 	chance of receiving a placement through our feedback process and have multiple avenues 	of support throughout.

                Yep! You will be paid on a contract basis. After the placement, depending on your
                <br/>
                performance and the resources of the company, you may receive an offer of ongoing 	employment that is determined between you and the company. The amount that you will 	receive will depend on the company and the role.

                <br/>
                Do I need to pay for the service?

                What are the processes involved to get a placement?
                <br/>
                The very first step is to make sure that you join our community by submitting your resume 	and getting feedback from the 2hats team.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                How does the feedback system work? What should I do after receiving a feedback?
                <br/>
                We want to help you grow, which is feedback is at the core of 2hats. Once you submit your 	resume you'll either get a notification letting you know you have passed to the next round or 	which areas need improvement. You are able to resubmit up to 3 times with multiple 	feedback documents from the 2hats team.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Should I fill in the profile or upload the resume?
                <br/>
                You have the option of going with either. As long as you fill in your profile or upload your 	resume, you'll be added into review by the 2hats team.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                How long do I need to wait for my feedback?
                <br/>
                This varies as some candidates will progress to the next stage where as others may receive 	the feedback to see where they need to improve. You'll receive this feedback as soon as 	possible.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Will I be interviewed by the company again?
                <br/>
                Once you have completed your placement you won't be interviewed again. The 2hats team 	will use your original responses in our system as well as the feedback from your past 	working histories to place you into another company.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                How long is the professional placement?
                <br/>
                It varies depending on the structure and the arrangement, in general, the initial contract is 	between 3-6-month, subject to negotiation between you and the company. It will all be 	clearly outlined before you begin.
