                How does 2hats assess the candidates?
                <br/>
                We assess all our SuperInterns on a variety of different qualities including both soft and 	hard skills and their ability to immediately generate value.
                <br/>

                How can I be sure the interns from 2hats deliver the results for my business?
                <br/>
                All our SuperInterns are trained and assessed by our 2hats 7-Step Selection Process. We 	make sure that there is feedback and consultations with you and our SuperInterns to 	maximise success and reduce risk.

                <br/>
                What's the process?
                <br/>
                We use the 2hats 7-Step Selection Process to make sure that each of our SuperInterns are 	the best. You can view the process on the companies page with descriptions of each step.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                What does the certified training entail?
                <br/>
                As part of our 2hats SuperIntern Selection Process, we train every successful candidate 	before they start their internship. The training is role-specific so that they are able to get 	started the very next day.

                <br/>
                <br/>
                What information do I have to assess the ability of the candidates?
                <br/>
                In addition to our recommendation, we also provide you with access to our SuperInterns 	pitches, allowing you to see their ability to respond to questions and solve problems.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                What if I am not satisfied with the candidates?
                <br/>
                We do regular consultations with you to make sure that you receive the most support from 	us. We provide you with a variety of SuperInterns so that you can find the right people for 	your business. In the highly unlikely case that you are unhappy with the SuperIntern, we are 	able to help you find a replacement within the 3 months of the internship.

                <br/>
                <br/>
                How quickly will I receive my SuperInterns?

                What support do you provide to students on placements?

                We give all our SuperInterns feedback allowing them to grow and improve. On top of 	ongoing consultations with you, we also check in with our SuperInterns to ensure their 	success.

                Nope! Our fee structure is clear and we don't charge any hidden 	fees. If you decide to hire the

                Is the fee one-off?
