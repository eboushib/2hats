                Each party will comply with all laws applicable to the actions contemplated in this Agreement, including all state regulations and export control laws, this Agreement shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of Australia, without giving effect to any principles that provide for the application of the law of another jurisdiction.

                <br/>
                2hats expressly disclaims any liability that may arise between Users of the 2hats Service. 2hats is only a venue for connecting Users through 2hats platform. Because 2hats is not involved in the actual contract/legal agreement between Users or in the completion of the employment, in the event that You have a dispute with one or more Users, You release 2hats (and our officers, directors, agents, investors, subsidiaries, and employees) from any and all claims, demands, or damages (actual or consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, suspected and unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                2hats encourages You to try and resolve disputes with other Users directly, to use a certified mediation (such as online dispute resolution processes) or an arbitration entity, or to report any illegal activity to your local police or law enforcement agency as appropriate.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Any controversy or claim arising out of, or in connection with, these Terms of Use between 2hats and You may be settled by independent, confidential mediation by reference to a commercial disputes centre, at either party’s election. You and 2hats agree to be bound by the outcome of that mediation. Each of You and 2hats will bear its own costs (and split equally any joint costs) of mediating the dispute.

                In the event that a provision of this Agreement is found to be unlawful, conflicting with another provision of the Agreement, or otherwise unenforceable, the Agreement will remain in force as though it had been entered into without that unenforceable provision being included in it. If two or more provisions of this Agreement are deemed to conflict with each other’s operation, 2hats shall have the sole right to elect which provision remains in force. Headings in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and will not be used in its construction and/or interpretation.

                We reserve all rights permitted to us under this Agreement as well as under the provisions of any applicable law. Our non-enforcement of any particular provision or provisions of this Agreement or the any applicable law will not be construed as Our waiver of the right to enforce that same provision under the same or different circumstances at any time in the future.

                14. Client Specific Terms
                <br/>
                14.1. Description of Service for Clients
                <br/>
                As a Client, You have the opportunity to find qualified talent and reduce the costs involved with hiring and retaining such talent. You may submit interview requests ("Requests") for Candidates on Our Service that You feel may be a fit for Your company or organisation. However, these Requests are non-binding and do not create a binding contract. A Success Fee (as defined in Section 14.4 below) is collected from You in accordance herein after You have successfully hired a Candidate. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT 2HATS DOES NOT INQUIRE INTO THE BACKGROUNDS OF ITS USERS OR ATTEMPT TO VERIFY THE STATEMENTS OF ITS USERS (ALTHOUGH IT RESERVES THE RIGHT TO CONDUCT ANY BACKGROUND CHECK OR OTHER SCREENINGS AT ANY TIME USING AVAILABLE PUBLIC RECORDS). YOU AGREE TO (1) CONDUCT ANY BACKGROUND CHECKS, REFERENCE CHECKS, OR OTHER DUE DILIGENCE THAT YOU MAY REQUIRE BEFORE ENGAGING ANY CANDIDATE, AND (2) COMPLY WITH ALL LAWS AND REGULATIONS RELATING TO THE INTENDED CONTRACT OF ANY CANDIDATE."
                <br/>
                <br/>
                14.2. Registration for Client
                <br/>
                To use 2hats as a Client You must register. Registration is free. When registering We may ask You for additional information related to Your company or organisation and the types of Candidates You are looking for. We may also allow You to use a third party service such to register. We will review the information that You provided to us during the registration process and any other information that is publicly available. We reserve the right, in Our sole discretion, to accept or reject Your registration to use Our Site and Service. If Your registration is accepted, You will be allowed to engage with, and make Requests to, Candidates that have posted their profiles on 2hats.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                14.3. Batch Process - Client’s Role
                <br/>
                "Batches" mean periodic processes offered by the Service that Candidates will use to find new career opportunities. The Batches do not create any contractual obligation between Candidates or Clients. Batches merely allow Candidates to meet Clients who may be interested in hiring them. "Successful Hire" is defined as a Candidate accepting a Covered Offer. "Qualified Introduction" occurs when a Candidate accepts an Interview Request from a Client.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                After a Client’s registration has been accepted by us, the Client will be able to post the Job offers on Our Site, communicate anonymously with these Candidates, and submit preliminary non-binding Requests in response to batches conducted by Candidates. If a Client hires a Candidate from Our Site, the Client will owe 2hats a Success Fee (as defined in Section 14.4 below).
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Once a Client has discovered a Candidate on Our Site or Service, the Client agrees to communicate exclusively with the Candidate through Our Site and Service for the duration of the pre-batch, batch and Request process. The Client and the Candidate may use other means of communication during the hiring process. The Client agrees not to attempt to circumvent Our Site and Service by independently attempting to communicate and hire the Candidate through alternative means after discovering the Candidate on Our Site or Service.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                14.4. Success Fees
                <br/>
                For purposes of this Agreement, "Success Fee" shall refer to 2hat’s then-current prevailing list price for Covered Offers by Clients accepted by Candidates. Client agrees to pay the Success Fee/s charged to Client’s account in accordance with the fee/s, charges, and billing terms in effect at the time the Success Fee is due and payable hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of a Success Fee dispute, if a Client can establish that the Client had an Active Process (as defined below) with the Candidate before using Our Site and/or Service (e.g., the Candidate had already begun the interview process with the Client and such process had not been terminated, or the Client had received the Candidate’s resume from an employment agency or head-hunter and the Candidate was under active consideration by the Client), the Client may be exempted from paying the Success Fee. However, the final determination as to whether a Success Fee is owed by the Client for an accepted Covered Offer will be at the sole discretion of 2hats. For the purposes hereof, "Active Process" shall mean continuous direct, back &amp; forth communication, in an active recruiting or hiring context where a decision to put a candidate on hold or reject has not been made, within the three (3) months prior to using the Site or Service for a Candidate that exists in Client’s applicant tracking system or that was submitted by a recruiting agency.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                IF YOU ARE A CLIENT who is using Our Site and/or Service, You agree to the Success Fee provisions, and the fees, charges, and billing terms in effect at the time the Success Fee is due and payable. If You do not agree with any of the provisions of this Agreement, please terminate Your account immediately and cease using 2hats. YOUR OBLIGATION TO PAY ANY SUCCESS FEES SHALL SURVIVE ANY TERMINATION OF THIS AGREEMENT.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                If a Client circumvents Our Site and/or Service after discovering a Candidate through Our Site or Service and subsequently hires that Candidate within twelve (12) months of the date on which the Client first viewed the Candidate on the Site, the Client will pay a Success Fee equal to 25% of the industrial average annual compensation of the Candidate and 2hats may, in its sole discretion, terminate the Client’s account.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                14.5. Payment for Clients
                <br/>
                Once We have accepted the registration of a Client, the Client will be able to make Requests and contact (through the Service) Candidates listed on Our Site and Service. If a Candidate identified through use of Our Service accepts a Covered Offer within twelve (12) months of the date on which the Client first viewed the Candidate on the Site, the Client will be charged a Success Fee.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                As a Client You agree that (1) if You make a Covered Offer, You shall (a) provide 2hats with a copy of a fully executed Covered Offer employment offer letter, or (b) execute a document between You, 2hats and Candidate that states material employment terms, including, among other things, Start Date, key terms and compensation, promptly upon the signing of a Covered Offer employment offer letter between You and such Candidate (the "Effective Date"), as requested by 2hats, (2) You will promptly notify 2hats should the Start Date or offer terms change at any time, and (3) You will promptly notify 2hats after termination of the Candidate’s employment as an employee, intern, coop employee, consultant or contractor ("Employment") in the event that (a) such Employment is terminated based on unsatisfactory performance within ninety (90) days of the date on which it commenced, (b) the Candidate voluntarily terminates Employment within ninety (90) days of the date on which Employment commenced, or (c) before the Start Date, either Client or Candidate elect not to begin the Employment contemplated by the Covered Offer.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                14.6. Subscription Agreements
                <br/>
                Clients engaged in a Subscription Agreement with 2hats (individually a "Subscription Client" and collectively "Subscription Clients") will be charged a Subscription fee as agreed upon between the Client and 2hats for the period as agreed upon between the parties (the "Subscription Period"). During the Subscription Period, the Subscription Client will be able to browse, request, contact (through the Service) and extend Covered Offers to Candidates listed on Our Site and Service. Unless otherwise agreed in writing all Covered Offers accepted within the Subscription Period will not be subject to any additional fees beyond the Subscription Agreement fees as agreed upon between You and 2hats.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Subscription Clients are required to promptly notify 2hats once a Candidate has accepted a Covered Offer and notify 2hats of the Start Date for such Candidate (including prompt notification of any subsequent changes in such Start Date). Subscription Clients shall provide 2hats with (1) a copy of a fully executed Covered Offer, or (2) execute a document between the Subscription Client, 2hats and Candidate that states material contractual terms, including, among other things, Start Date and compensation promptly upon the Effective Date. In the event that before the Start Date, either the Subscription Client or Candidate elect not to begin the relationship contemplated by the Covered Offer, the Subscription Client shall promptly notify 2hats and the Candidate shall not be eligible for any Candidate Payment.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                If a Subscription Client circumvents Our Site and Service after discovering a Candidate through Our Site or Service and subsequently hires that Candidate within twelve (12) months of the date on which the Client first viewed the Candidate on the Site, the Subscription Client will pay a Success Fee equal to 25% of the 1st year base salary or prorated contractor compensation of the Candidate and 2hats may, in its sole discretion, terminate the Subscription Client’s account.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                14.7. Payment
                <br/>
                Client agrees to pay the Success Fees charged to Client’s account in accordance with the fees, charges, and billing terms in effect at the time the Success Fee is due and payable hereunder. All fees (such as Success Fees or Subscription Fees) for the 2hats Service are due and payable net thirty (30) days from the date indicated on each invoice as sent to Client by 2hats.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Success Fees incur on the date which a Candidate commences work under an Employment Offer or Contractor Engagement is the "Start Date".
                <br/>
                <br/>
                14.8. Replacement
                <br/>
                At 2hats We value Our Client’s satisfaction in using Our Site and Service to hire great Candidates. If (1) a Candidate voluntarily terminates his or her Employment within ninety (90) days of the Start Date, or (2) Candidate does not start Employment or Contractor Engagement because either Client or Candidate elects not to begin the employment relationship contemplated in the Covered Offer (each, a "Termination Event"), upon written receipt and confirmation of such information, 2hats will provide Client a replacement candidate of the same quality.
                <br/>
                <br/>

                15.1. Description of Service for Candidates
                <br/>
                2hats is an online service that connects Candidates with Clients through a non-binding batch interview request process for a Candidate’s services. 2hats provides free assessment feedback at each stage of the talent filtering process for all candidates if required. Eligible Candidates have an opportunity to find a position with a Client with transparency as to role and compensation in each interview request. Additionally, Candidates’ use of 2hats is free, and the batch process is non-binding and does not create any contractual obligations between the Client and the Candidate. The batch only acts as a tool for Candidates to explore opportunities without obligation.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                15.2. Registration for Candidate

When registering with 2hats, We may require You to provide us information such as Your name, e-mail address, employment history, work experience, educational background and skill set. Furthermore, You agree to provide us with any other identifying documents that We may request. We will review the information that You provide to us during the registration process and We may also review any other information about You that is publicly available.

                15.3. Batch Process - Candidate’s Role
                <br/>
                After a Candidate has registered and created a profile on 2hats, he or she will be able to create a listing for a batch using software made available by us through the Service. Candidates are solely responsible for running their own batches. Clients will then have the opportunity to engage with Candidates for their services through the Request process. By creating a listing and using the batch process, the Candidate can see which Clients may be interested in hiring him or her. At the conclusion of the Request process the Candidate may, but is not required to, contact any Client that made a Request to him or her. All requests by Clients through Our Site and Service are non-binding. The Candidate agrees not to attempt to circumvent Our Site and Service by independently attempting to communicate with a Client that contacted or communicated with him or her on Our Site or Service.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                15.4. Payments for Candidates
                <br/>

                Notwithstanding anything else to the contrary in this Agreement, no Candidate Payment and/or Contractor Payment will be due or paid to any Candidate or Contractor who fails to provide 2hats all of the following within one hundred twenty (120) days of the Start Date for Candidates or one hundred twenty (120) days of the Completion Date for contractors: (i) a copy of the Covered Offer offer letter; and (ii) all banking information necessary for electronic payment, including but not limited to the bank name, address and account number to which the payment should be made.

                2hats expressly disclaims any liability that may arise between Users of the 2hats Service. 2hats is only a venue for connecting Users through 2hats platform. Because 2hats is not involved in the actual contract/legal agreement between Users or in the completion of the employment, in the event that You have a dispute with one or more Users, You release 2hats (and our officers, directors, agents, investors, subsidiaries, and employees) from any and all claims, demands, or damages (actual or consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, suspected and unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                2hats encourages You to try and resolve disputes with other Users directly, to use a certified mediation (such as online dispute resolution processes) or an arbitration entity, or to report any illegal activity to your local police or law enforcement agency as appropriate.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Any controversy or claim arising out of, or in connection with, these Terms of Use between 2hats and You may be settled by independent, confidential mediation by reference to a commercial disputes centre, at either party’s election. You and 2hats agree to be bound by the outcome of that mediation. Each of You and 2hats will bear its own costs (and split equally any joint costs) of mediating the dispute.

                We reserve all rights permitted to us under this Agreement as well as under the provisions of any applicable law. Our non-enforcement of any particular provision or provisions of this Agreement or the any applicable law will not be construed as Our waiver of the right to enforce that same provision under the same or different circumstances at any time in the future.

YOU UNDERSTAND THAT 2HATS DOES NOT INQUIRE INTO THE BACKGROUNDS OF ITS USERS OR ATTEMPT TO VERIFY THE STATEMENTS OF ITS USERS (ALTHOUGH IT RESERVES THE RIGHT TO CONDUCT ANY BACKGROUND CHECK OR OTHER SCREENINGS AT ANY TIME USING AVAILABLE PUBLIC RECORDS). YOU AGREE TO (1) CONDUCT ANY BACKGROUND CHECKS, REFERENCE CHECKS, OR OTHER DUE DILIGENCE THAT YOU MAY REQUIRE BEFORE ENGAGING ANY CANDIDATE, AND (2) COMPLY WITH ALL LAWS AND REGULATIONS RELATING TO THE INTENDED CONTRACT OF ANY CANDIDATE."

                After a Client’s registration has been accepted by us, the Client will be able to post the Job offers on Our Site, communicate anonymously with these Candidates, and submit preliminary non-binding Requests in response to batches conducted by Candidates. If a Client hires a Candidate from Our Site, the Client will owe 2hats a Success Fee (as defined in Section 14.4 below).
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Once a Client has discovered a Candidate on Our Site or Service, the Client agrees to communicate exclusively with the Candidate through Our Site and Service for the duration of the pre-batch, batch and Request process. The Client and the Candidate may use other means of communication during the hiring process. The Client agrees not to attempt to circumvent Our Site and Service by independently attempting to communicate and hire the Candidate through alternative means after discovering the Candidate on Our Site or Service.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                14.4. Success Fees
                <br/>
                For purposes of this Agreement, "Success Fee" shall refer to 2hat’s then-current prevailing list price for Covered Offers by Clients accepted by Candidates. Client agrees to pay the Success Fee/s charged to Client’s account in accordance with the fee/s, charges, and billing terms in effect at the time the Success Fee is due and payable hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of a Success Fee dispute, if a Client can establish that the Client had an Active Process (as defined below) with the Candidate before using Our Site and/or Service (e.g., the Candidate had already begun the interview process with the Client and such process had not been terminated, or the Client had received the Candidate’s resume from an employment agency or head-hunter and the Candidate was under active consideration by the Client), the Client may be exempted from paying the Success Fee. However, the final determination as to whether a Success Fee is owed by the Client for an accepted Covered Offer will be at the sole discretion of 2hats. For the purposes hereof, "Active Process" shall mean continuous direct, back &amp; forth communication, in an active recruiting or hiring context where a decision to put a candidate on hold or reject has not been made, within the three (3) months prior to using the Site or Service for a Candidate that exists in Client’s applicant tracking system or that was submitted by a recruiting agency.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                IF YOU ARE A CLIENT who is using Our Site and/or Service, You agree to the Success Fee provisions, and the fees, charges, and billing terms in effect at the time the Success Fee is due and payable. If You do not agree with any of the provisions of this Agreement, please terminate Your account immediately and cease using 2hats. YOUR OBLIGATION TO PAY ANY SUCCESS FEES SHALL SURVIVE ANY TERMINATION OF THIS AGREEMENT.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                If a Client circumvents Our Site and/or Service after discovering a Candidate through Our Site or Service and subsequently hires that Candidate within twelve (12) months of the date on which the Client first viewed the Candidate on the Site, the Client will pay a Success Fee equal to 25% of the industrial average annual compensation of the Candidate and 2hats may, in its sole discretion, terminate the Client’s account.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                14.5. Payment for Clients
                <br/>
                Once We have accepted the registration of a Client, the Client will be able to make Requests and contact (through the Service) Candidates listed on Our Site and Service. If a Candidate identified through use of Our Service accepts a Covered Offer within twelve (12) months of the date on which the Client first viewed the Candidate on the Site, the Client will be charged a Success Fee.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                As a Client You agree that (1) if You make a Covered Offer, You shall (a) provide 2hats with a copy of a fully executed Covered Offer employment offer letter, or (b) execute a document between You, 2hats and Candidate that states material employment terms, including, among other things, Start Date, key terms and compensation, promptly upon the signing of a Covered Offer employment offer letter between You and such Candidate (the "Effective Date"), as requested by 2hats, (2) You will promptly notify 2hats should the Start Date or offer terms change at any time, and (3) You will promptly notify 2hats after termination of the Candidate’s employment as an employee, intern, coop employee, consultant or contractor ("Employment") in the event that (a) such Employment is terminated based on unsatisfactory performance within ninety (90) days of the date on which it commenced, (b) the Candidate voluntarily terminates Employment within ninety (90) days of the date on which Employment commenced, or (c) before the Start Date, either Client or Candidate elect not to begin the Employment contemplated by the Covered Offer.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                14.6. Subscription Agreements
                <br/>
                Clients engaged in a Subscription Agreement with 2hats (individually a "Subscription Client" and collectively "Subscription Clients") will be charged a Subscription fee as agreed upon between the Client and 2hats for the period as agreed upon between the parties (the "Subscription Period"). During the Subscription Period, the Subscription Client will be able to browse, request, contact (through the Service) and extend Covered Offers to Candidates listed on Our Site and Service. Unless otherwise agreed in writing all Covered Offers accepted within the Subscription Period will not be subject to any additional fees beyond the Subscription Agreement fees as agreed upon between You and 2hats.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Subscription Clients are required to promptly notify 2hats once a Candidate has accepted a Covered Offer and notify 2hats of the Start Date for such Candidate (including prompt notification of any subsequent changes in such Start Date). Subscription Clients shall provide 2hats with (1) a copy of a fully executed Covered Offer, or (2) execute a document between the Subscription Client, 2hats and Candidate that states material contractual terms, including, among other things, Start Date and compensation promptly upon the Effective Date. In the event that before the Start Date, either the Subscription Client or Candidate elect not to begin the relationship contemplated by the Covered Offer, the Subscription Client shall promptly notify 2hats and the Candidate shall not be eligible for any Candidate Payment.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                If a Subscription Client circumvents Our Site and Service after discovering a Candidate through Our Site or Service and subsequently hires that Candidate within twelve (12) months of the date on which the Client first viewed the Candidate on the Site, the Subscription Client will pay a Success Fee equal to 25% of the 1st year base salary or prorated contractor compensation of the Candidate and 2hats may, in its sole discretion, terminate the Subscription Client’s account.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                14.7. Payment
                <br/>
                Client agrees to pay the Success Fees charged to Client’s account in accordance with the fees, charges, and billing terms in effect at the time the Success Fee is due and payable hereunder. All fees (such as Success Fees or Subscription Fees) for the 2hats Service are due and payable net thirty (30) days from the date indicated on each invoice as sent to Client by 2hats.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Success Fees incur on the date which a Candidate commences work under an Employment Offer or Contractor Engagement is the "Start Date".
                <br/>
                <br/>
                14.8. Replacement
                <br/>
                At 2hats We value Our Client’s satisfaction in using Our Site and Service to hire great Candidates. If (1) a Candidate voluntarily terminates his or her Employment within ninety (90) days of the Start Date, or (2) Candidate does not start Employment or Contractor Engagement because either Client or Candidate elects not to begin the employment relationship contemplated in the Covered Offer (each, a "Termination Event"), upon written receipt and confirmation of such information, 2hats will provide Client a replacement candidate of the same quality.

No contractual obligations are created for either the Candidate or the Client through the use of the Service. The Candidate is not obligated to accept the highest Request or any Request at all. Additionally, Requests submitted by a Client to a Candidate through the Request process are not binding on the Client. At the end of the Request process the Candidate may choose which Client, if any, he or she wishes to contact.

                <br/>
                PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                2hats expressly disclaims any liability that may arise between Users of the 2hats Service. 2hats is only a venue for connecting Users through 2hats platform. Because 2hats is not involved in the actual contract/legal agreement between Users or in the completion of the employment, in the event that You have a dispute with one or more Users, You release 2hats (and our officers, directors, agents, investors, subsidiaries, and employees) from any and all claims, demands, or damages (actual or consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, suspected and unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                2hats encourages You to try and resolve disputes with other Users directly, to use a certified mediation (such as online dispute resolution processes) or an arbitration entity, or to report any illegal activity to your local police or law enforcement agency as appropriate.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Any controversy or claim arising out of, or in connection with, these Terms of Use between 2hats and You may be settled by independent, confidential mediation by reference to a commercial disputes centre, at either party’s election. You and 2hats agree to be bound by the outcome of that mediation. Each of You and 2hats will bear its own costs (and split equally any joint costs) of mediating the dispute.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                13.5. Force Majeure
                <br/>
                You agree that We are not responsible to You for anything that We may otherwise be responsible for, if it is the result of events beyond Our control, including, but not limited to, acts of God, war, insurrection, riots, terrorism, crime, labour shortages (including lawful and unlawful strikes), embargoes, postal disruption, communication disruption, failure or shortage of infrastructure, shortage of materials, or any other event beyond Our control.

                13.6. Severability; Headings
                <br/>
                In the event that a provision of this Agreement is found to be unlawful, conflicting with another provision of the Agreement, or otherwise unenforceable, the Agreement will remain in force as though it had been entered into without that unenforceable provision being included in it. If two or more provisions of this Agreement are deemed to conflict with each other’s operation, 2hats shall have the sole right to elect which provision remains in force. Headings in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and will not be used in its construction and/or interpretation.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                13.7. Non-waiver
                <br/>
                We reserve all rights permitted to us under this Agreement as well as under the provisions of any applicable law. Our non-enforcement of any particular provision or provisions of this Agreement or the any applicable law will not be construed as Our waiver of the right to enforce that same provision under the same or different circumstances at any time in the future.
                <br/>
                <br/>

                The communications between You and 2hats use electronic means, whether You visit the Site or the Service or send 2hats e-mails, or whether 2hats posts notices on the Site or Service or communicates with You via e-mail. For contractual purposes, You (1) consent to receive communications from 2hats in an electronic form; and (2) agree that all terms, conditions, agreements, notices, disclosures, and other communications that 2hats provides to You electronically satisfy any legal requirement that such communications would satisfy if they were in writing.

                14. Client Specific Terms
                <br/>
                14.1. Description of Service for Clients
                <br/>
                As a Client, You have the opportunity to find qualified talent and reduce the costs involved with hiring and retaining such talent. You may submit interview requests ("Requests") for Candidates on Our Service that You feel may be a fit for Your company or organisation. However, these Requests are non-binding and do not create a binding contract. A Success Fee (as defined in Section 14.4 below) is collected from You in accordance herein after You have successfully hired a Candidate. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT 2HATS DOES NOT INQUIRE INTO THE BACKGROUNDS OF ITS USERS OR ATTEMPT TO VERIFY THE STATEMENTS OF ITS USERS (ALTHOUGH IT RESERVES THE RIGHT TO CONDUCT ANY BACKGROUND CHECK OR OTHER SCREENINGS AT ANY TIME USING AVAILABLE PUBLIC RECORDS). YOU AGREE TO (1) CONDUCT ANY BACKGROUND CHECKS, REFERENCE CHECKS, OR OTHER DUE DILIGENCE THAT YOU MAY REQUIRE BEFORE ENGAGING ANY CANDIDATE, AND (2) COMPLY WITH ALL LAWS AND REGULATIONS RELATING TO THE INTENDED CONTRACT OF ANY CANDIDATE."
                <br/>
                <br/>
                14.2. Registration for Client
                <br/>
                To use 2hats as a Client You must register. Registration is free. When registering We may ask You for additional information related to Your company or organisation and the types of Candidates You are looking for. We may also allow You to use a third party service such to register. We will review the information that You provided to us during the registration process and any other information that is publicly available. We reserve the right, in Our sole discretion, to accept or reject Your registration to use Our Site and Service. If Your registration is accepted, You will be allowed to engage with, and make Requests to, Candidates that have posted their profiles on 2hats.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                14.3. Batch Process - Client’s Role
                <br/>
                "Batches" mean periodic processes offered by the Service that Candidates will use to find new career opportunities. The Batches do not create any contractual obligation between Candidates or Clients. Batches merely allow Candidates to meet Clients who may be interested in hiring them. "Successful Hire" is defined as a Candidate accepting a Covered Offer. "Qualified Introduction" occurs when a Candidate accepts an Interview Request from a Client.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                After a Client’s registration has been accepted by us, the Client will be able to post the Job offers on Our Site, communicate anonymously with these Candidates, and submit preliminary non-binding Requests in response to batches conducted by Candidates. If a Client hires a Candidate from Our Site, the Client will owe 2hats a Success Fee (as defined in Section 14.4 below).
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Once a Client has discovered a Candidate on Our Site or Service, the Client agrees to communicate exclusively with the Candidate through Our Site and Service for the duration of the pre-batch, batch and Request process. The Client and the Candidate may use other means of communication during the hiring process. The Client agrees not to attempt to circumvent Our Site and Service by independently attempting to communicate and hire the Candidate through alternative means after discovering the Candidate on Our Site or Service.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                14.4. Success Fees
                <br/>
                For purposes of this Agreement, "Success Fee" shall refer to 2hat’s then-current prevailing list price for Covered Offers by Clients accepted by Candidates. Client agrees to pay the Success Fee/s charged to Client’s account in accordance with the fee/s, charges, and billing terms in effect at the time the Success Fee is due and payable hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of a Success Fee dispute, if a Client can establish that the Client had an Active Process (as defined below) with the Candidate before using Our Site and/or Service (e.g., the Candidate had already begun the interview process with the Client and such process had not been terminated, or the Client had received the Candidate’s resume from an employment agency or head-hunter and the Candidate was under active consideration by the Client), the Client may be exempted from paying the Success Fee. However, the final determination as to whether a Success Fee is owed by the Client for an accepted Covered Offer will be at the sole discretion of 2hats. For the purposes hereof, "Active Process" shall mean continuous direct, back &amp; forth communication, in an active recruiting or hiring context where a decision to put a candidate on hold or reject has not been made, within the three (3) months prior to using the Site or Service for a Candidate that exists in Client’s applicant tracking system or that was submitted by a recruiting agency.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                IF YOU ARE A CLIENT who is using Our Site and/or Service, You agree to the Success Fee provisions, and the fees, charges, and billing terms in effect at the time the Success Fee is due and payable. If You do not agree with any of the provisions of this Agreement, please terminate Your account immediately and cease using 2hats. YOUR OBLIGATION TO PAY ANY SUCCESS FEES SHALL SURVIVE ANY TERMINATION OF THIS AGREEMENT.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                If a Client circumvents Our Site and/or Service after discovering a Candidate through Our Site or Service and subsequently hires that Candidate within twelve (12) months of the date on which the Client first viewed the Candidate on the Site, the Client will pay a Success Fee equal to 25% of the industrial average annual compensation of the Candidate and 2hats may, in its sole discretion, terminate the Client’s account.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                14.5. Payment for Clients
                <br/>
                Once We have accepted the registration of a Client, the Client will be able to make Requests and contact (through the Service) Candidates listed on Our Site and Service. If a Candidate identified through use of Our Service accepts a Covered Offer within twelve (12) months of the date on which the Client first viewed the Candidate on the Site, the Client will be charged a Success Fee.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                As a Client You agree that (1) if You make a Covered Offer, You shall (a) provide 2hats with a copy of a fully executed Covered Offer employment offer letter, or (b) execute a document between You, 2hats and Candidate that states material employment terms, including, among other things, Start Date, key terms and compensation, promptly upon the signing of a Covered Offer employment offer letter between You and such Candidate (the "Effective Date"), as requested by 2hats, (2) You will promptly notify 2hats should the Start Date or offer terms change at any time, and (3) You will promptly notify 2hats after termination of the Candidate’s employment as an employee, intern, coop employee, consultant or contractor ("Employment") in the event that (a) such Employment is terminated based on unsatisfactory performance within ninety (90) days of the date on which it commenced, (b) the Candidate voluntarily terminates Employment within ninety (90) days of the date on which Employment commenced, or (c) before the Start Date, either Client or Candidate elect not to begin the Employment contemplated by the Covered Offer.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                14.6. Subscription Agreements
                <br/>
                Clients engaged in a Subscription Agreement with 2hats (individually a "Subscription Client" and collectively "Subscription Clients") will be charged a Subscription fee as agreed upon between the Client and 2hats for the period as agreed upon between the parties (the "Subscription Period"). During the Subscription Period, the Subscription Client will be able to browse, request, contact (through the Service) and extend Covered Offers to Candidates listed on Our Site and Service. Unless otherwise agreed in writing all Covered Offers accepted within the Subscription Period will not be subject to any additional fees beyond the Subscription Agreement fees as agreed upon between You and 2hats.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Subscription Clients are required to promptly notify 2hats once a Candidate has accepted a Covered Offer and notify 2hats of the Start Date for such Candidate (including prompt notification of any subsequent changes in such Start Date). Subscription Clients shall provide 2hats with (1) a copy of a fully executed Covered Offer, or (2) execute a document between the Subscription Client, 2hats and Candidate that states material contractual terms, including, among other things, Start Date and compensation promptly upon the Effective Date. In the event that before the Start Date, either the Subscription Client or Candidate elect not to begin the relationship contemplated by the Covered Offer, the Subscription Client shall promptly notify 2hats and the Candidate shall not be eligible for any Candidate Payment.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                If a Subscription Client circumvents Our Site and Service after discovering a Candidate through Our Site or Service and subsequently hires that Candidate within twelve (12) months of the date on which the Client first viewed the Candidate on the Site, the Subscription Client will pay a Success Fee equal to 25% of the 1st year base salary or prorated contractor compensation of the Candidate and 2hats may, in its sole discretion, terminate the Subscription Client’s account.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                14.7. Payment
                <br/>
                Client agrees to pay the Success Fees charged to Client’s account in accordance with the fees, charges, and billing terms in effect at the time the Success Fee is due and payable hereunder. All fees (such as Success Fees or Subscription Fees) for the 2hats Service are due and payable net thirty (30) days from the date indicated on each invoice as sent to Client by 2hats.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Success Fees incur on the date which a Candidate commences work under an Employment Offer or Contractor Engagement is the "Start Date".
                <br/>
                <br/>
                14.8. Replacement
                <br/>
                At 2hats We value Our Client’s satisfaction in using Our Site and Service to hire great Candidates. If (1) a Candidate voluntarily terminates his or her Employment within ninety (90) days of the Start Date, or (2) Candidate does not start Employment or Contractor Engagement because either Client or Candidate elects not to begin the employment relationship contemplated in the Covered Offer (each, a "Termination Event"), upon written receipt and confirmation of such information, 2hats will provide Client a replacement candidate of the same quality.
                <br/>
                <br/>

                <br/>
                15.1. Description of Service for Candidates
                <br/>
                2hats is an online service that connects Candidates with Clients through a non-binding batch interview request process for a Candidate’s services. 2hats provides free assessment feedback at each stage of the talent filtering process for all candidates if required. Eligible Candidates have an opportunity to find a position with a Client with transparency as to role and compensation in each interview request. Additionally, Candidates’ use of 2hats is free, and the batch process is non-binding and does not create any contractual obligations between the Client and the Candidate. The batch only acts as a tool for Candidates to explore opportunities without obligation.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                15.2. Registration for Candidate
                <br/>
                In order to use 2hats as a Member You must register and create a profile. The use of the Site and the Service is free for Candidates. When registering with 2hats, We may require You to provide us information such as Your name, e-mail address, employment history, work experience, educational background and skill set. Furthermore, You agree to provide us with any other identifying documents that We may request. We will review the information that You provide to us during the registration process and We may also review any other information about You that is publicly available. We reserve the right, in Our sole discretion, to accept or reject Your registration to use Our Site and Service. If Your registration is accepted, You will be allowed to use Our Service.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Upon the acceptance of Your registration, You will be subject to a selection process to assess your eligibility and/or suitability in accessing specific job postings by Our Clients. Only eligible Candidates have the exclusive right to access jobs available to Them.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Candidates must attend all assessment centres arranged by 2hats which may include a skype interview, psychometric test and/or face to face interview.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                15.3. Batch Process - Candidate’s Role
                <br/>
                After a Candidate has registered and created a profile on 2hats, he or she will be able to create a listing for a batch using software made available by us through the Service. Candidates are solely responsible for running their own batches. Clients will then have the opportunity to engage with Candidates for their services through the Request process. By creating a listing and using the batch process, the Candidate can see which Clients may be interested in hiring him or her. At the conclusion of the Request process the Candidate may, but is not required to, contact any Client that made a Request to him or her. All requests by Clients through Our Site and Service are non-binding. The Candidate agrees not to attempt to circumvent Our Site and Service by independently attempting to communicate with a Client that contacted or communicated with him or her on Our Site or Service.
